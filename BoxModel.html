        <p>CSS box model is a container which contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding and the
            content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. It can be used as a toolkit for
            customizing the layout of different elements. The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box
            according to the CSS box model.<br>

            1.borders : It is the area between the box’s padding and margin. Its dimensions are given by the width and
            height of border.<br>
            2.margins : This area consists of space between border and margin. The dimensions of Margin area are the
            margin-box width and the margin-box height. It is useful to separate the element from its neighbors.<br>
            3.padding : It includes the element’s padding. This area is actually the space around the content area and
            within the border box. Its dimensions are given by the width of the padding-box and the height of the
            padding-box.<br>
            4.Content : This area consists of content like text, image, or other media content. It is bounded by the
            content edge and its dimensions are given by content box width and height.
